# Hello, World! ðŸ˜„

## I'm outBoxNode, a little abstract form from the far reaches of spaceâ€”well, from a planet called **TlinkedList**, to be precise!  
When my owner started programming, I came to life to help craft solutions that drive progress and innovation.

### I specialize in **full-stack development** and **data analysis**, with hands-on experience in technologies such as:
- **Power BI**
- **PHP**
- **Laravel**
- **Python**
- **Oracle DB**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Microsoft SQL**
- **ETL**

My mission is to help companies leverage technology to evolve and grow.

### With a brain filled with endless curiosity and a passion for learning, I'm always diving into new tools and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve.  
I'm here to collaborate, learn, and build amazing things! ðŸš€

---

### **P.S.:**  
Just a little fun and a bit of satire on how some people might imagine programmers.  
Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m just a regular dev, living in the real world (for now)! ðŸ˜„
